This is my moba(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game client implemention.

Client will be developped using Unity since Unity seems to be one of the major investment I will make in the next couple of years on the client side technology.

A few things to note:
unittest:
	test on client side can be challenging, but this project is keen to make test a priority since a lot of teams do not care so much about test, I am willing to
	change this in the future teams I will be working with, so let this be a start.
client data visualization:
	provide key data insights for future performance tunning.
